🚗💥 Exploring 7.7M US Accident Records (2016-2023): Surprising Insights!

Did you know that Miami has the highest recorded accidents among U.S. cities, but NYC, the most populated city, ranks only 45th? 🤯

I recently conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing 7.7 million accident records, and here are some key takeaways:

📌 Top Accident Locations: 

1. Most recorded accidents (State): California 🌉
2. Most recorded accidents (City): Miami, FL ☀️
3. New York State ranks 5th, but NYC sees significantly fewer accidents than expected. Could public transport or congestion play a role? 🚇

📌 Time & Weather Patterns:

1. 🚦 Peak hours: 7-10 AM & 4-7 PM (morning/evening rush)
2. 📅 More accidents on working days than weekends
3. 🌡️ Temperature matters! Most accidents occur between 20°C - 30°C, with a peak at 25°C (170,984 accidents)

📌 City-Level Insights
1. Only <4% of cities have >2,000 accidents
2. 1,023 cities recorded only ONE accident in the entire dataset! 


💡 These findings raise interesting questions:
1. Why does NYC have fewer accidents despite high population density?
2. How does temperature impact accident rates?
3. What policies could improve safety during rush hours?
